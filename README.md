# Excel_to_sqlite3
Store data from excel into an sqlite3 database

A tool for storing specific excel spreadsheets into an sqlite3 database.
The format of the spreadsheets is designed for a certain job I do, so it might not be useful to others.
An example of one excel spreadsheet will be added so people can test how it works.
IMPORTANT:
A proper path for the database must be set on your machine before you test it, or it will not display everything as it should.
All comments are in English, the rest of the data is in English/Croatian.
I do not have the time to translate everything into English at the moment, but the code itself is clear as to what it does, 
and the comments describe every batch of code, so anyone should be able to understand how and why something does what it does.

The GUI was created with tkinter
Excel spreadsheet data is read using openpyxl
Database is controled using the sqlite3 module.

If there are any questions, contact me and I will try to get to it as soon as I can.

Feel free to copy, use, reuse, edit, multiply the code.

ps: self taught programmer, so my apologies if something is not up to industry standards or under optimized
